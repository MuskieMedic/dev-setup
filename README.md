# Dev Setup

So the story behind this repo is quite amazing. So I being a lazy ass and a linux nerd(I experiment a lot with my machines) which most of the time(almost all time ) used to break something and when I try fixing that I end up make a complete mesh of my machine so I have to use the ultimate weapon of every developer that is clean install my machine. I know that sucks because you have to setup everything from scratch. So I kind of thought why don't I have something to automate all this bullshit donkey work by just running simple command. I evaluated few of the options like vagrant and docker but I kind of use docker to run almost evrything but then too I needed do few of the basic setup. Vagrant is vmbox underneath which makes it heavy as I don't have a ultimate beast machine yet. Also I have come across the Boxen but that is too much for setting up personal machine because it uses puppet which not too easy to setup, I don't wanted to go down the puppet rabbit hole.
So I thought let's go bash way.
